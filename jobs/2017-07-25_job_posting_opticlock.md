[![QUARTIQ](/quartiq_small.png)](/)

QUARTIQ is a young company based in Berlin, Germany, developing next-generation control systems for Quantum Information experiments and products. Together with our partners worldwide, we are providing the **open-source software stack [ARTIQ](https://m-labs.hk/artiq/)** and the **open hardware ecosystem [Sinara](https://github.com/m-labs/sinara)** to research labs and industry.

As a pilot project for the European flagship program on Quantum Technologies, a collaboration of experienced research groups and high-tech industry teams will develop **[opticlock](http://www.opticlock.de/en/info/), a demonstrator of a compact, high-availability and high-accuracy optical clock using trapped ions**.
QUARTIQ is developing the complete stack of control components, software, and algorithms for the device.

To support these efforts, we are hiring exceptionally skilled individuals with a strong background in **Quantum Physics**, **Electrical Engineering**, and **Software engineering**.

## Responsibilities

* Extending and designing features for ARTIQ
* Providing advice and input on hardware designs of Sinara components
* Translating optical clock and ion trapping recipes into ARTIQ experiments
* Developing novel algorithms for autonomous operation of optical clocks
* Designing and implementing interfaces for novel cutting-edge hardware from Sinara and from other industry and academic partners contributing to opticlock
* Shaping the long term ARTIQ and Sinara goals and their road maps
* Advising and collaborating with physicists and engineers on opticlock

## Requirements

* Master's degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, or related or Bachelor's degree in the above fields with five years of working experience
* Demonstrated experience in software engineering
* Demonstrated collaboration in and significant contributions to multiple open-source software projects
* Quick learning skills and assimilation of novel programming languages (e.g. Rust) and engineering concepts
* Fluent in Python and GNU/Linux
* Proficient in English and German
* Proven problem-solving capabilities
* Ability to work collaboratively in a distributed team environment
* Willingness to take on novel and unforeseen challenges and to dive deep into other fields

## Bonus points

* Proficient in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Physics
* Experience in working with programmable logic (FPGAs)
* Experience in working in major Quantum Physics laboratories
* Experience in building and debugging digital hardware
* Experience in designing and improving domain specific languages
