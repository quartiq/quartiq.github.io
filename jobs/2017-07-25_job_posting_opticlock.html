<p>QUARTIQ is developing open-source next-generation control systems for Quantum Information experiments and products. Together with our partners worldwide, we are providing the software stack <a href="https://m-labs.hk/artiq/">ARTIQ</a> and the hardware ecosystem <a href="https://github.com/m-labs/sinara">SINARA</a> to research labs and industry.</p>
<p>As a pilot project for the European flagship program on Quantum Technologies, a collaboration of experienced research groups and high-tech industry will develop <a href="http://www.opticlock.de/en/info/">opticlock</a>, a demonstrator of a compact optical clock with a high availability for end-users. QUARTIQ is developing the complete stack control components, software, and algorithms for the device.</p>
<p>To support these efforts, we are hiring exceptionally skilled individuals with a strong background in Quantum Physics, Electrical Engineering, and Software engineering.</p>
