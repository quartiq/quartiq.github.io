<p>QUARTIQ is a young company in Berlin, Germany developing next-generation control systems for Quantum Information experiments and products. Together with our partners worldwide, we are providing the <strong>open-source software stack <a href="https://m-labs.hk/artiq/">ARTIQ</a></strong> and the <strong>open hardware ecosystem <a href="https://github.com/m-labs/sinara">Sinara</a></strong> to research labs and industry.</p>
<p>As a pilot project for the European flagship program on Quantum Technologies, a collaboration of experienced research groups and high-tech industry teams will develop <strong><a href="http://www.opticlock.de/en/info/">opticlock</a>, a demonstrator of a compact, high-availability and high-accuracy optical clock using trapped ions</strong>. QUARTIQ is developing the complete stack of control components, software, and algorithms for the device.</p>
<p>To support these efforts, we are hiring exceptionally skilled individuals with a strong background in <strong>Quantum Physics, Electrical Engineering, and Software engineering</strong>.</p>
